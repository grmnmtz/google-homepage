Google Homepage Clone

May 11th 2021

I created a Google Homepage Clone as my first project on The Odin Project 

Basic Skills needed and learnt along the way:

Git
Github
Developer Tools 
Command Line
Text Editors 
Basic UX/UI 
Color Theory
Typography
Basic HTML
Basic CSS
CSS Flexbox 
CSS Grid


Note:
This is a very basic solution and I'm aware it's not perfect. 
I'll probably go back to it redesign it in the future. 
Thanks for passing by.
